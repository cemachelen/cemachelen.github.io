# <center>About Me </center>

I'm currently a Software Development Scientist for [CEMAC (Center of Excellence for Modelling the Atmosphere and Climate)](http://cemac.leeds.ac.uk).

## Short Bio: ##
<p> I came into Earth Sciences doing an Integrated Masters undergraduate degree in Earth Sciences at Oxford University. I soon became interested in the Geophysical side of things particularly Ocean and Climate sciences which lead me choose a Master's Project studying eddy heat and salt fluxes in the North Atlantic, working closely with AOPP. I then moved to Southampton to do a PhD in numerical ocean modelling investigating diabatic eddies in the Southern Ocean. This required a lot of computational efficiency and python scripting to ensure a vast number of model runs were completed and a large amount of data analysed.
